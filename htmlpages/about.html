This platform is designed to streamline the attendance tracking 
process for educationalinstitutions.To begin,colleges must first
register,providing their essential information,including collegename,
contact details,and a uniqueidentifier such as a college ID.Once 
registered,users can choosetheir role,by selecting their college 
either as a lecturer or a student.Lecturers have the ability to 
take attendance efficiently through this platform.They can create
and manage class sessions,mark attendance for each student,and keep
a digital record of attendance history.This feature not only simplifies
the attendance-taking process also reduces paperwork,allowing lecturers
to focus more on the educational aspects of their role.On the other 
hand, students can access the platform to view their attendance records.
By logging in with their credentials,students gain real-time insights into
their attendance percentages,providing them with a transparent overview
of their class attendance.This empowers students to take responsibility 
for their attendance and stay informed about their academic progress.
